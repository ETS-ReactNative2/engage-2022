# Agile development Methodology

- I divided the one-month program into four sprints. Each sprint consisted of one week period.
- I categorized my sprints into four sections

  - Exploration
  - Core Functionality
  - Frontend and Backend Integration
  - Features and UI

- We were given a problem statements in which we had to demonstrate the use of domains given.
- <u> First week</u>: Researched the domains given. I even implemented 1 simple application each in both machine learning and face recognition with the help of blogs and youTube. After that and taking the practical exams into consideration, I decided to work on face recognition.
  Then I spent the week on setting up basic backend and API calls.
- <u> Second week</u>: Completed the core functionality i.e. calling the API, setting fake data and recommending the products based on parameters received from the Azure API. Then I worked on the various features in backend.
- <u> Third week:</u> Finished the backend and set up simple frontend.
- <u>Fourth week</u>, I worked on frontend and adding more functionalities like authentication and payment system. Fixed some bugs.
